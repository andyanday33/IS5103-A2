              The Web is a world constructed for and by people from different countries, ages, expertise, skills, and
              social status. Nowadays, web users can access the web from all kinds of devices such as their personal
              phones, iPad, tablets, and computers. It is common that the web users have any kind of disability due to
              their birth, ageing, accident, metal trauma.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, providing Web Accessibility is a way to ensure that an enormous range of users can access and
              use the Web pages.
