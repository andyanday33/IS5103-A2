              Web accessibility is the practise of limiting the boundaries that interrupt
              interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web for people with various kinds of
              disabilities
              or socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The web is a world constructed for and by people from different countries, ages, expertise, skills, and
              social status. Nowadays, web users can access the web from all kinds of devices such as their personal
              phones, iPad, tablets, and computers. It is common that the web users may have any kind of disability due
              to
              their birth, ageing, accidents, or trauma.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, providing web accessibility is a way to ensure that a large range of users can access and
              use web pages.

            <p>
              The target audience of this website is <strong>beginner developers</strong> who already have a knowledge
              of web technology and are beginning to think about web accessibility to increase the overall performance
              of
              developing their webpages.

            <h3>Aged web viewers</h3>
            <p>Much of the web is not accessible for aged people. Every
              individual
              needs the internet to communicate with each other, to search solutions for their working tasks and
              to
              address basic information needed. </p>
            <p>The accessibility regulations or policies are not enough to guarantee web
              accessibility.
              Moreover, even a few websites meet the guidelines, some elder users can still encounter accessible
              issues.</p>

            <h3>Visually Impaired Users

            <p>Compared with the amount of regular web users without any impairments, the number of blind users
              seems to be less, however, it is important to raise the concern of providing accessible and usable
              web service to the blind. It is equal for everyone to have access to and make attributes to the
              development of Internet. </p>

            <h3>Users with Reduced Mobility</h3>
            <p>People with reduced mobility often encounter a lot of difficulties when accessing the web. They may
              not be able to move their hands or legs as flexibly as normal people. When using a computer to access
              the Internet, it may not be possible to complete some specific operations through the keyboard or
              mouse. For them, the web page is not highly accessible.
