                      <p>Firstly, much of the web is not accessible for aged people. Every
                        individual
                        needs the internet to communicate with each other, to search solutions for their working tasks
                        and
                        to
                        address basic information needed. </p>
                      <p>Secondly, the accessibility regulations or policies are not enough to guarantee web
                        accessibility.
                        Moreover, even a few websites meet the guidelines, some elder users can still encounter
                        accessible
                        issues.</p>

                      <h3 class="card-title">difficulty</h3>
                      <p>It is widely accepted that the aging abilities of elderly people who have the need of Internet
                        are
                        experiencing age-related impairments such as visual, hearing, physical inconvenience, slower
                        reactivity, cognitive impairments.</p>
                      <p>For example:  
                        Eyesight declines significantly affecting daily living  
                        estimates:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>15.8% of people 65 to 74 years</li>
                        <li>18.7% of people 75 to 84 years</li>
                        <li>45.8% of people over 85 years</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>According to Andrew(2009), it is found that when facing with older users, lots of issues
                        happened
                        related
                        with usable accessibility rather than technical accessibility. These usability issues include
                        aspects
                        such as the presentation of the web content, the inexperience of older people, and the
                        information
                        overloaded often experienced. There is always a need of usable browsers which can accommodate
                        all
                        different kinds of experience, skills and impairments of older users and others in accessing the
                        Web[1].

                  <p>According to Aqueasha(2020), a case study is mentioned about older content creators and web
                    accessibility planning which is aiming at ensuring access to online content for older adults and
                    people
                    with impairments.  

                     
                  </p>
                  <p>What is interesting about this case study is that during the accessibility planning process, the
                    older
                    content creators take part in at the very beginning which is an extremely efficient way to take
                    an overview of the webpage whether it is accessible for older people rather than all content and
                    design is already done waiting for refinements to meet the guidelines of web accessibility[2].</p>

                      accessibility
                      issues.</p>
                    <p>Compared with the amount of regular web users without any impairments, the number of blind users
                      seems to be less, however, it is important to raise the concern of providing accessible and usable
                      web service to the blind. It is equal for everyone to have access to and make attributes to the
                      development of Internet. </p>

                    <p>Because of visual impairment, users usually access the web content by the
                      assistive
                      reading technologies provided by the web browsers and interact with the Internet by touch
                      methods
                      such as the blind keyboard to input. So, it is helpful for the web page designers to let their
                      content accessible and compatible with these technologies which are essential to the blind users.

                    <p class="mb-1">Web accessibility is always a crucial problem for blind users or users with colour
                      blindness.

                      As a society, it is important to raise concerns and find more tools to improve web accessibility
                      for web viewers with eye impairment. </p>
                    <p class="mb-1">It is widely known that screen reader is the main technique that help the blind
                      get
                      information
                      from the web page However, this is an approach which is time consuming to navigate the viewers to
                      their

                      desired content. </p>
                    <p class="mb-1">According to Pauli (2011), there has been a suggestion to divide the web page into
                      different
                      parts
                      logically in which the web viewers could navigate through the logical descriptive title and index
                      numbers
                      according to their own interest. By this method, the web accessibility could be improved by
                      reducing
                      time
                      to
                      help viewers get to the information they need. The whole concept of this method is called
                      IVRS
                      (Interactive Voice Response Systems). By this system, visually impaired users could access the
                      webpage
                      through
                      hearing
                      the index information on their mobile phone and selecting the navigating numbers by touching them
                      on their
                      keypad
                      [1].

                  <p class="mb-1">According to Alexander (2021), there has been a project with a goal to produce a more
                    efficient and
                    accurate
                    system that aids web accessibility using a sample of webpages. This system would
                    generate a
                    combined
                    accessibility assessment by adding existing tools alongside developer testing. Because of the
                    large-scale
                    need
                    of
                    evaluation of the webpages, efficiency is the key element in the field of testing websites for

                <h3 class="card-title">Introduction</h3>
                <p>People with reduced mobility often encounter a lot of difficulties when accessing the web. They may
                  not be able to move their hands or legs as flexibly as normal people. When using a computer to access
                  the Internet, it may not be possible to complete some specific operations through the keyboard or
                  mouse. For them, the web page is not highly accessible.

                <ul>
                  <li>Users cannot use mouse or keyboard to type words or search information </li>

                  <li> Windows have many parts, and it can be hard to transfer one page to another page </li>

                  <li> Choosing specific functions or menus in a webpage can be difficult </li>

                  <li> Navigating a webpage by means of scrolling may not be possible </li>

                    <p>According to Arias (2016), it is hoped to develop a navigation system based on eye movement and
                      web interaction through eye
                      tracking. The working principle of this plug-in is to complete the required action by capturing
                      the positioning and movement of the user's eyes.
                    </p>

                    <p>By adding additional navigation bars on both sides of the webpage, the corresponding menus and
                      function options will pop up through the point of view on the screen. The eyes actually act as a
                      mouse, while the gaze acts as a click. Similarly for text input, the plug-in provides an
                      interactive input for the user's eyes on a virtual keyboard. This will greatly enhance the
                      accessibility of the web page to this group of people. </p>



                    <p>In the cursor interaction, the user controls the point of the cursor by moving the line of sight
                      of the eye. The cursor is in the form of a hollow circle. When the user wants to click a button at
                      a specified position, they only need to stop moving and look at the position, and the hollow
                      circle
                      will gradually be filled with a circle full of color. When the color is full, the click
                      instruction will be triggered to complete the operation. </p>
