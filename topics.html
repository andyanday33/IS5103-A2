                    <p>Firstly, it is still truth that much of the web is not accessible for aged people. Every
                      individual
                      needs the internet to communicate with each other, to search solutions for their working tasks and
                      to
                      address basic information needed. </p>
                    <p>Secondly, the accessibility regulations or policies are not enough to guarantee web
                      accessibility.
                      Moreover, even a few websites meet the guidelines, some elder users can still encounter accessible
                      issues.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">difficulty</h3>
                    <p>It is widely accepted that the aging abilities of elderly people who have the need of Internet
                      are
                      experiencing age-related impairments such as visual, hearing, physical inconvenience, slower
                      reactivity, cognitive impairments.</p>
                    <p>For example:  
                      Eyesight declines significantly affecting daily living  
                      estimates:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>15.8% of people 65 to 74 years</li>
                      <li>18.7% of people 75 to 84 years</li>
                      <li>45.8% of people over 85 years</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>According to Andrew, it is found that when facing with older users, lots of issues happened
                      related
                      with usable accessibility rather than technical accessibility. These usability issues include
                      aspects
                      such as the presentation of the web content, the inexperience of older people, and the information
                      overloaded often experienced. There is always a need of usable browsers which can accommodate all
                      different kinds of experience, skills and impairments of older users and others in accessing the
                      Web[1].

                <p>According to Aqueasha , he mentioned a case study about older adult content creators and web
                  accessibility planning which is aiming at ensuring access to online content for older adults and
                  people
                  with impairments.  

                   
                </p>
                <p>What is interesting about this case study is that during the accessibility planning process, the
                  older
                  adults content creators take part in at the very beginning which is an extremely efficient way to take
                  an overview of the webpage whether it is accessible for the older people rather than all content and
                  design is already done waiting for refinements to meet the guidelines of web accessibility[2].</p>

                      issues.</p>
                    <p>Compared with the amount of regular web users without any impairments, the number of blind users
                      seems to be less, however, it is important to raise the concern of providing accessible and usable
                      web service to the blind. It is equal for everyone to have access to and make attributes to the
                      development of Internet. </p>

                    <p>Because of the visual impairment, the blind people usually access the web content by the
                      assistive
                      reading technologies provided by the web browsers and interact with the Internet by touching
                      method
                      such as the blind keyboard to input. So, it is helpful for the web page designers to let their
                      content accessible and compatible with these technologies which are essential to the blind users.

                    <p class="mb-1">Web accessibility is always a crucial problem for the blind people or colour
                      blindness
                      people.
                      It
                      is more consciously for the society to raise concern and find more tools to improve the web
                      accessibility
                      for
                      the web viewers with eye impairment. </p>
                    <p class="mb-1">It is widely known that screen reader is the main technique that help the blind to
                      get
                      information
                      from the web page However, this is an approach which is time costing to navigate the viewers to
                      their
                      most
                      interested content. </p>
                    <p class="mb-1">According to Pauli (2011), there has been a suggestion of divide the web page into
                      different
                      parts
                      logically in which the web viewers could navigate through the logical descriptive title and index
                      numbers
                      according to their own interest. By this method, the web accessibility could be improved by
                      reducing
                      time
                      to
                      help viewers to get to the information they need. The whole concept of this method is called an
                      IVRS
                      (Interactive Voice Response Systems). By this system, the blind people could access the webpage
                      through
                      hearing
                      the index information on their mobile phone and selecting the navigating numbers through pressing
                      on the
                      keypad
                      [1].

                    accessibility assessment by add existing tools and alongside developer testing. Because of the

                    of

                <p>People with reduced mobility often encounter a lot of difficulties when accessing the web. They may
                  not be able to move their hands or legs as flexibly as normal people. When using a computer to access
                  the Internet, it may not be possible to complete some specific operations through the keyboard or
                  mouse. For them, the web page is not highly accessible.

                    <p>According to Arias (2016),they hope to base on eye movement and web interaction through eye
                      tracking. The working principle of this plug-in is to complete the required action by capturing
                      the positioning and movement of the user's eyesight[1].
                    </p>

                    <p>By adding additional navigation bars on both sides of the webpage, the corresponding menus and
                      function options will pop up through the point of view on the screen. The eyes actually act as a
                      mouse, while the gaze acts as a click. Similarly for text input, the plug-in provides an
                      interactive input for the user's eyes on a virtual keyboard. This will greatly enhance the
                      accessibility of the web page to this group of people. </p>



                    <p>In the cursor interaction, the user controls the point of the cursor by moving the line of sight
                      of the eye. The cursor is in the form of a hollow circle. When the user wants to click a button at
                      a specified position, he only needs to stop moving and look at the position, and the hollow circle
                      will gradually be filled with a circle full of color. When the color is full, the click
                      instruction will be triggered to complete the operation. </p>
