            <p class="mb-1">Web accessibility is always a crucial problem for the blind people or colour blindness
              people.
              It
              is more consciously for the society to raise concern and find more tools to improve the web accessibility
              for
              the web viewers with eye impairment. </p>
            <p class="mb-1">It is widely known that screen reader is the main technique that help the blind to get
              information
              from the web page However, this is an approach which is time costing to navigate the viewers to their most
              interested content. </p>
            <p class="mb-1">According to Pauli (2011), there has been a suggestion of divide the web page into different
              parts
              logically in which the web viewers could navigate through the logical descriptive title and index numbers
              according to their own interest. By this method, the web accessibility could be improved by reducing time
              to
              help viewers to get to the information they need. The whole concept of this method is called an IVRS
              (Interactive Voice Response Systems). By this system, the blind people could access the webpage through
              hearing
              the index information on their mobile phone and selecting the navigating numbers through pressing on the
              keypad
              [1].
            </p>
            <p class="mb-1">According to Alexander (2021), there has been a project with a goal to produce a more
              efficient
              accurate
              system that access the web accessibility regarding to a sample of webpages. This system would generate a
              combined
              accessibility assessment by add existing tools and alongside developer testing. Because of the large-scale
              need
              of
              evaluation of the webpages, the efficiency is the key element in the field of testing websites for the
              blind
              users [2].
            </p>
            <p class="mb-1">This approach improves automated testing coverage by absorbing the exist evaluative tools
              and
              minimise inaccuracy by sampling.
