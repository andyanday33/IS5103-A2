                    <p>Firstly, much of the web is not accessible for aged people. Every
                      individual
                      needs the internet to communicate with each other, to search solutions for their working tasks and
                      to
                      address basic information needed. </p>
                    <p>Secondly, the accessibility regulations or policies are not enough to guarantee web
                      accessibility.
                      Moreover, even a few websites meet the guidelines, some elder users can still encounter accessible
                      issues.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">difficulty</h3>
                    <p>It is widely accepted that the aging abilities of elderly people who have the need of Internet
                      are
                      experiencing age-related impairments such as visual, hearing, physical inconvenience, slower
                      reactivity, cognitive impairments.</p>
                    <p>For example:  
                      Eyesight declines significantly affecting daily living  
                      estimates:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>15.8% of people 65 to 74 years</li>
                      <li>18.7% of people 75 to 84 years</li>
                      <li>45.8% of people over 85 years</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>According to Andrew(2009), it is found that when facing with older users, lots of issues happened
                      related
                      with usable accessibility rather than technical accessibility. These usability issues include
                      aspects
                      such as the presentation of the web content, the inexperience of older people, and the information
                      overloaded often experienced. There is always a need of usable browsers which can accommodate all
                      different kinds of experience, skills and impairments of older users and others in accessing the
                      Web[1].

                <p>According to Aqueasha(2020), a case study is mentioned about older content creators and web
                  accessibility planning which is aiming at ensuring access to online content for older adults and
                  people
                  with impairments.  

                   
                </p>
                <p>What is interesting about this case study is that during the accessibility planning process, the
                  older
                 content creators take part in at the very beginning which is an extremely efficient way to take
                  an overview of the webpage whether it is accessible for older people rather than all content and
                  design is already done waiting for refinements to meet the guidelines of web accessibility[2].</p>

                      issues.</p>
                    <p>Compared with the amount of regular web users without any impairments, the number of blind users
                      seems to be less, however, it is important to raise the concern of providing accessible and usable
                      web service to the blind. It is equal for everyone to have access to and make attributes to the
                      development of Internet. </p>

                    <p>Because of visual impairment, users usually access the web content by the
                      assistive
                      reading technologies provided by the web browsers and interact with the Internet by touch
                      methods
                      such as the blind keyboard to input. So, it is helpful for the web page designers to let their
                      content accessible and compatible with these technologies which are essential to the blind users.

                    <p class="mb-1">Web accessibility is always a crucial problem for blind users or users with colour
                      blindness.
                
                      As a society, it is important to raise concerns and find more tools to improve web accessibility for web viewers with eye impairment. </p>
                    <p class="mb-1">It is widely known that screen reader is the main technique that help the blind
                      get
                      information
                      from the web page However, this is an approach which is time consuming to navigate the viewers to
                      their
                  
                      desired content. </p>
                    <p class="mb-1">According to Pauli (2011), there has been a suggestion to divide the web page into
                      different
                      parts
                      logically in which the web viewers could navigate through the logical descriptive title and index
                      numbers
                      according to their own interest. By this method, the web accessibility could be improved by
                      reducing
                      time
                      to
                      help viewers get to the information they need. The whole concept of this method is called
                      IVRS
                      (Interactive Voice Response Systems). By this system, visually impaired users could access the webpage
                      through
                      hearing
                      the index information on their mobile phone and selecting the navigating numbers by touching them
                      on their
                      keypad
                      [1].

                    efficient and
                    accurate
                    system that aids web accessibility using a sample of webpages. This system would
                    generate a
                    combined
                    accessibility assessment by adding existing tools alongside developer testing. Because of the
                    large-scale
                    need
                    of
                    evaluation of the webpages, efficiency is the key element in the field of testing websites for
                    the

                <h3 class="card-title">Introduction</h3>
                <p>People with reduced mobility often encounter a lot of difficulties when accessing the web. They may
                  not be able to move their hands or legs as flexibly as normal people. When using a computer to access
                  the Internet, it may not be possible to complete some specific operations through the keyboard or
                  mouse. For them, the web page is not highly accessible.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Users cannot use mouse or keyboard to type words or search information </li>

                  <li> Windows have many parts, and it can be hard to transfer one page to another page </li>

                  <li> Choosing specific functions or menus in a  webpage can be difficult </li>

                  <li> Navigating a webpage by means of scrolling may not be possible </li>

                </ul>

                    <h3 class="card-title">Details and Cases/ exist tools working principle</h3>
                    <p>According to Arias (2016), it is hoped to develop a navigation system based on eye movement and web interaction through eye
                      tracking. The working principle of this plug-in is to complete the required action by capturing
                      the positioning and movement of the user's eyes.
                    </p>

                    <p>By adding additional navigation bars on both sides of the webpage, the corresponding menus and
                      function options will pop up through the point of view on the screen. The eyes actually act as a
                      mouse, while the gaze acts as a click. Similarly for text input, the plug-in provides an
                      interactive input for the user's eyes on a virtual keyboard. This will greatly enhance the
                      accessibility of the web page to this group of people. </p>



                    <p>In the cursor interaction, the user controls the point of the cursor by moving the line of sight
                      of the eye. The cursor is in the form of a hollow circle. When the user wants to click a button at
                      a specified position, they only need to stop moving and look at the position, and the hollow circle
                      will gradually be filled with a circle full of color. When the color is full, the click
                      instruction will be triggered to complete the operation. </p>
