              More often than not, the majority of people take for granted the easiness of accessing and navigating
              through web content. This is not as easy for users with disabilities such as visual, speech, auditory or
              physical disabilities. Assistive technologies exist to provide further accessibility to such users,
              examples are screen magnifiers, screen readers and voice recognition software. The World Wide Web
              Consortium (W3C) created the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) whose sole purpose was to develop
              resources and strategies for increased web accessibility for people with disabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines were then developed for the purpose of improving the navigability
              and comprehension of web content. The initial accessibility guidelines, WCAG 1.0, were implemented in
              1999, and consisted of 14 guidelines along with corresponding priority factors. For example, Priority
              level 1 refers to accessibility checkpoints that a web developer must satisfy. Priority levels 2 and 3
              refer to checkpoints that the developer should and may satisfy, respectively. Satisfying more priority
              levels mean that more groups of users will have improved accessibility to the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              The current version of the guidelines is WCAG 2.2, which improves upon the range of disabilities such as
              photosensitivity, low vision and cognitive limitations. Moreover, conformance comes in three levels and is
              a factor by which success criteria/priority levels are satisfied. The three levels of conformance are A,
              AA, AAA from the lowest to highest. According to WCAG 2.2, the web standards and guidelines are
              predominantly split into factors relating to perceivability, operability, understandability and robustness
              of the web content and interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              Within these factors, WCAG 2.2 specifies further elements that it can be broken down into. When it comes
              to perceivability, the web content and interface must be presented to the user in numerous possible ways
              in which it can be perceived. For example, for any non-text content such as images, audio and video
              (time-based media), there must be alternatives. These alternatives can range from braille, larger print,
              live captions, and audio descriptions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Operability refers to the web interface and its components being navigable to all users. This ranges from
              factors such as ensuring that none of the content has potential to cause any seizures or physical
              reactions. Moreover, one of the key success criteria of operability is ensuring that any user would be
              able to navigate the content using a standard keyboard interface. This would mean that the appropriate
              shortcuts would need to be coded when the website is designed, such as shortcuts to turn it on and off.
              Understandability is also a vitally important factor in web accessibility in that the overall information
              presented to the user is clear, easy to read and understandable. For websites that have options for the
              user to enter input, appropriate instructions and labels should be easily identifiable. Finally, the last
              major factor in web accessibility is robustness, which refers to compatibility with user agents.
              Conformance levels range from A to AAA, where A is the minimum level of conformance and AAA satisfies all
              the WCAG 2.2 success criteria. Indeed, achieving AAA level of conformance is typically not possible as
              mostly all websites feature content where a specific success criterion may not be met.
            </p>

              Web accessibility is including all the practise of promising there are no boundaries that interrupt
              interaction with, or access to, website on the World Wide Web by people with various kinds of disabilities
              or socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. (Via Wikipedia)
            </p>
            <p>
              The Web is a world constructed for and by people from different countries, ages, expertise, skills, and
              social status. Nowadays, web users can access the web from all kinds of devices such as their personal
              phones, iPad, tablets, and computers. It is common that the web users have any kind of disability due to
              their birth, ageing, accident, metal trauma.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, providing Web Accessibility is a way to ensure that an enormous range of users can access and
              use the Web pages.

            </p>
            <p>
              The guidelines are not perfect, at least from the perspective of experts in usability and human-computer
              interaction.

              According to Miquel, four major criticisms have been listed:

              Firstly, the guidelines are not proofed by actual statistical research targeted at users.

              Secondly, the guidelines don’t focus on the needs of elderly people or people with cognitive impairment.

              Thirdly, the content of guideline is not understandable by a typical web developer.

              Finally, it is demanding the developers to focus on easy compliance rather than real web accessibility.

              So, it is more important to raise awareness to web accessibility because of the imperfection of the
              current guidelines.
